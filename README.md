Here we need to perpare two POSCAR which are happened to piezoelectric changes and cubic phase for compared.

For the 90Â° domain wall model, the atomic planes parallel to the domain wall are the ABO and O2 planes. Coordinates and displacements follow these equation:

The coordinates and displacements of unit cells whose central planes are a and b planes can be calculated as:

After the coordinates and displacements of unit cells are determined, the shear strain e5 can be calculated as:
